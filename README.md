# Task-Oriented Dialogue System to create User Stories
The code uses LangChain and LangGraph to build a dialogue system to help users create User Stories.
The flow of the application is:
1. User says something
2. LLM reads the messages history and decides if it's ready to create the User Story or if the user should respond again
